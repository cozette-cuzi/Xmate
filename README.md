# Xmate
Application to help users find a mate/company in any kind of activity, for example find a sport mate, a roommate, a sudy mate, or whatever come to mind.
It starts by the user introducing his/her interests using general keyworks such as (sport, reading, yoga...) to help the model suggest useful results. 
Then users can post about what they are looking for, and people with similar interests will see the post and be able to interact with a comment. 

## Technical Overview
The application is build with **Laravel PHP** for the backend, and **Vue.js** for the frontend.
Besides that it has a model built with **Python**, which is being connected to the backend through an API built with Python as well.
